                    I am a student at the University of Leeds. My origins are from the United Arab Emirates.
                     I grew up in a house in the suburbs of Al Ain, where it's covered with golden dunes.
                      I grew up with a lot of animals around me, and I always loved them.
                       I wanted to help them but never knew how.
                        I always thought that one day these animals will become extinct.
                         So, I want to preserve them since they represent one of the national emblems in every country.
